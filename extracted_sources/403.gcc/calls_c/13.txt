     If we would have to push a partially-in-regs parm
     before other stack parms, preallocate stack space instead.

     If the size of some parm is not a multiple of the required stack
     alignment, we must preallocate.

     If the total size of arguments that would otherwise create a copy in
     a temporary (such as a CALL) is more than half the total argument list
     size, preallocation is faster.

     Another reason to preallocate is if we have a machine (like the m88k)
     where stack alignment is required to be maintained between every
     pair of insns, not just when the call is made.  However, we assume here
     that such machines either do not have push insns (and hence preallocation
     would occur anyway) or the problem is taken care of with
     PUSH_ROUNDING.  */
