     anyway.  If SDB is ever caught doing the Wrong Thing for multi-
     dimensional arrays, then we'll have to put the AT_ordering attribute
     back in.  (But if and when we find out that we need to put these in,
     we will only do so for multidimensional arrays.  After all, we don't
     want to waste space in the .debug section now do we?)  */
