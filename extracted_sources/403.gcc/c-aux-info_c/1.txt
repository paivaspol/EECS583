  /* If we got to here, then we are trying to generate an ANSI style formal
     parameters list.

     New style prototyped ANSI formal parameter lists should in theory always
     contain some stuff between the opening and closing parens, even if it is
     only "void".

     The brutal truth though is that there is lots of old K&R code out there
     which contains declarations of "pointer-to-function" parameters and
     these almost never have fully specified formal parameter lists associated
     with them.  That is, the pointer-to-function parameters are declared
     with just empty parameter lists.

     In cases such as these, protoize should really insert *something* into
     the vacant parameter lists, but what?  It has no basis on which to insert
     anything in particular.

     Here, we make life easy for protoize by trying to distinguish between
     K&R empty parameter lists and new-style prototyped parameter lists
     that actually contain "void".  In the latter case we (obviously) want
     to output the "void" verbatim, and that what we do.  In the former case,
     we do our best to give protoize something nice to insert.

     This "something nice" should be something that is still valid (when
     re-compiled) but something that can clearly indicate to the user that
     more typing information (for the parameter list) should be added (by
     hand) at some convenient moment.

     The string chosen here is a comment with question marks in it.  */
